           <li>Staffs are very professional, friendly and caring to the kids. My kids are happy and enjoyed the services provided by the child care.
           <p><strong>Frelyn B – Nov 2014</strong></p> 
           </li>
           <li>Very good service, caring all children. I have found staff is very friendly and caring. They provide good educational programs and plenty activities for children. More important that fee is low compared to other centers
           <p><strong>Prince Dec 2014</strong></p>

            <li>Had both my kids at Funny Days. They had carers who grew very attached to them and vice versa. I knew I could leave them at daycare and go to work feeling confident kids are being well taken care of.
           <p><strong>Sarika McLay – May 2016</strong></p> 
           </li>
           <li>My daughter is very shy and fussy eater. The carers are very friendly and patient with her and she now enjoys going to childcare everyday and be with her carers and friends.

           <li>First & Best experience @ this child care. We started with 2 days a week and now are on 5 days a week! Simply because our boy loves it! The management and the staff are outstanding. We have other day care facilities only meters away from where we live, BUT this child care is worth the trouble to drive our boy to the facility. Extremely pleased and consider ourselves blessed to have got our boy with Funny Days!! Thanks again
